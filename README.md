sig-detection
=============

A significant signal detection library. The basis of this library is off of the work by Hildebrand and Sekhon (1974),
which describes a method for objectively determining the noise level in Doppler spectra. This method works on an
individual spectrum (Sn), and through an iterative process, truncates Sn until the criterion for white noise is 
satisfied.
